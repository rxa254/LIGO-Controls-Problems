# LIGO-Controls-Problems
A few examples of control system challenges in the LIGO project
1. Local damping of quadruple suspension using shadow sensors on the TOP stage
2. Angular control of a Fabry-Perot cavity with a quad suspension on each end
3. Hierarchical control of the differential arm cavity lengths, actuating on all 4 stages.
